# A Machine Learning Application to Predicting Customer Churn

![Overall Framework](https://i.ibb.co/c8MFc7x/2.jpg)
This project demonstrates applying a 3 step general-purpose framework to solve problems with machine learning. The purpose of this framework is to provide a scaffolding for rapidly developing machine learning solutions across industries and datasets.

The end outcome is a both a specific solution to a customer churn use case, with a reduction in revenue lost to churn of more than 10%, as well as a general approach you can use to solve your own problems with machine learning.
