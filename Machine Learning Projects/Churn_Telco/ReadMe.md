# A Machine Learning Application to Predicting Customer Churn

![Overall Framework](https://i.ibb.co/c8MFc7x/2.jpg)


This project demonstrates applying a 3 step general-purpose framework to solve problems with machine learning. The purpose of this framework is to provide a scaffolding for rapidly developing machine learning solutions across industries and datasets.

The end outcome is a both a specific solution to a customer churn use case, with a reduction in revenue lost to churn of more than 10%, as well as a general approach you can use to solve your own problems with machine learning.

## Framework Steps

1.	**Prediction engineering**
-	State business need
-	Translate business requirement into machine learning task by specifying problem parameters
-	Develop set of labels along with cutoff times for supervised machine learning
2.	**Feature Engineering**
-	Create features - predictor variables - out of raw data
-	Use cutoff times to make valid features for each label
-	Apply automated feature engineering to automatically make hundreds of relevant, valid features
3.	**Modeling**
-	Train a machine learning model to predict labels from features
-	Use a pre-built solution with common libraries
-	Optimize model in line with business objectives
